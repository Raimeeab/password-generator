# Password Generator
--- 

![Password-generator-demo](assets/images/password-generator-demo.png)

## Description 

- My motivation is to create a password generator using JavaScript and the existing CSS/ HTML code provided
- The aim of this porject is to allow the user to select their preference of what characters they would like to use (Uppercase/ Lowercase letters, numbers and symbols)
- The current code does not display alerts, prompts for the user to select desired characters, nor does it have a working function for a password generator.

## Technologies Used 
HTML, Advanced CSS and basic JavaScript. 

## Usage 
Follow the prompts on the page to select desired characters for your password generator, then click generate button to get your password. 

## Logic: 
BEGIN 

    * When user hits generate password button, it will prompt the user to input how long their password should be (min 8, max 128) 
    * This will be followed by a series of confirms 
        * "Do you want <special character> in your generated password?"  (OK || Cancel) x4
        * If user does not select atleast one of the options, an error message will appear and loop the confirms until criteria is met 
    * When all all prompts are answered, a password is generated to match criteria selected 
    * Password is then displayed on the page
